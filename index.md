# How to use Franklin

\tableofcontents <!-- you can use \toc as well -->

This section is meant as a refresher if you're new to Franklin.
Have a look at both how the website renders and the corresponding markdown (`index.md`).
Modify at will to get a feeling for how things work!

Ps: if you want to modify the header or footer or the general look of the website, adjust the files in
* `src/_css/` and
* `src/_html_parts/`.

## Header and Footer

As you can see here at the bottom of the page, there is a footer which you may want on all pages but for instance you may want the date of last modification to be displayed.
In a fashion heavily inspired by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), you can write things like

```html
Last modified: {{ fill fd_mtime }}.
```

(cf. `src/_html_parts/page_foot.html`) which will then replace these braces with the content of a dictionary of variables at the key `fd_mtime`.
This dictionary of variables is accessed locally by pages through `@def varname = value` and globally through the `config.md` page via the same syntax.

There's a few other such functions of the form `{{fname p₁ p₂}}` as well as support for conditional blocks. If you wander through the `src/_html_parts/` folder and its content, you should be able to see those in action.
